"""Assert that live branch protection matches the documented policy, field by field.

An undocumented protection exception is indistinguishable from a misconfiguration,
and a policy document that outlives the configuration it describes is worse than
none. This gate fails in both drift directions: when live protection weakens
relative to `quality/branch_protection_policy.v1.json`, and when the documented
zero-approval exception is removed without the configuration strengthening.

The policy document is the only repository-specific input, so a sibling
repository can lift this script verbatim and edit the table. Absent settings are
compared as absent, never coerced to false (a missing
`required_pull_request_reviews` block and `required_approving_review_count: 0`
are different postures and must be distinguishable).

**This file must pass `mypy --strict` and `ruff` under the strictest settings any
adopter uses.** It began from the shared estate control and now also measures the
GraphQL-only required-deployment posture. Keep repository-independent behavior
portable so the improved control can be contributed back to its central owner.

  python scripts/check_branch_protection_policy.py --offline   # document shape only
  python scripts/check_branch_protection_policy.py             # live comparison (needs gh auth)
